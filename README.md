# AutoSnitch
AutoSnitch is a package comprising of a mobile application and a collection of BLE devices  that facilates a secure and fair examination enviroment in order to ensure that no person is given an unfair advantage. The way Autosnitch carries this out is through the magic of BLE 4.0 devices. These BLE devices will be assigned to each respective desk of a person taking an exam. Pressing on a BLE device in the midst of an exam causes it to emit a beacon which causes the AutoSnitch app to notify the exam supervisor of suspicious activity and the location at which it is taking place. This will allow the exam invigilator to inspect this area for any unusual activity. We believe Autosnitch will be a great way of detering students from cheating and pay dividends to students who work hard and fair to obtain their grades.
